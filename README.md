IR Project: search for movies based on their plot description

## Datasets :
For this project we used two dataset found on kaggle :
- https://www.kaggle.com/code/willacy/exploring-movie-plots-nlp-and-clustering
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

The reason behind using two datasets, is that one of them has larger and more descriptive plots, and the others has user reviews, which allow us to add a weight to our recommendation system.

## Code : 
The code is split into multiple sections, first working with the first dataset, then the second, and finally a mix of the two. Also, some of the functions used are inspired from already existing code found here on github or other websites of sort.
